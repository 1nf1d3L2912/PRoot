Release v0.6
============

New features
------------

* Added support for "asymmetric" path mirrors.

    The command-line option for mirrors was extended to support the
    syntax "-m <p1>:<p2>" where <p1> is the location of the mirror
    within the alternate rootfs and <p2> is the path to the real
    directory/file.  For instance you can now mirror the whole host
    rootfs in the directory "/hostfs" within the alternate rootfs that
    way::

        proot -m /:/hostfs ...

* Added an option to disable ASLR (Address Space Layout
  Randomization).

    RHEL4 and Ubuntu 10.04 use an ASLR mechanism that creates
    conflicts between the layout of QEMU and the layout of the target
    program.  This new option is automatically set when QEMU is used.

* Added "/etc/resolv.conf" and $HOME to the list of mirrored paths
  when using the option -M or -Q.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed the detranslation of getcwd(2) and readlink(2).

* Improved the build compatibility on old/broken distro.

* Added support for pthread cancellation when QEMU is used.

* Set QEMU's fake argv[0] to the program actually launched, not to the
  initial script name.

* Create the path up to the mirror location to cheat "walking"
  programs.
