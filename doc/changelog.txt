Release v0.7.0
==============

* Search the guest program in $PATH relatively to the guest rootfs,
  for instance you can now just write::

      proot /path/to/guest/rootfs/  perl

  instead of::

      proot /path/to/guest/rootfs/  /usr/bin/perl

* The command-line interface was re-written from scratch, the only
  incompatible change is that QEMU options are now separated by
  spaces::

     proot -Q "qemu-arm -g 1234" ...

  instead of::

     proot -Q qemu-arm,-g,1234 ...

* New option "-0": force syscalls "get*id" to report identity 0, aka
  "root".

* Many fixes, code refactoring, new testing framework, ...

Special thanks to Claire ROBINE for her contribution.


Release v0.6.2
==============

* Change the default command from $SHELL to "/bin/sh".  The previous
  behaviour led to an unexpected error -- from user's point-of-view --
  when $SHELL didn't exit in the new root file-system.

* Fix *partially* support for readlink(2) when mirror pathes are in
  use.  Prior this patch, any symbolic link -- that points to an
  absolute path which prefix is equal to the host-side of any mirror
  path -- was bugged.  For instance, the command "proot -m /bin:/host
  $ROOTFS /usr/bin/readlink /usr/bin/ps" returned "/host" instead of
  "/bin/ps".

* Add the option "-V" to print the version then exit.

* Be more explicit when a wrong command-line argument is used.

* Remove the SIGSEGV help message: it was too confusing to the user.

* Use a new shining build-system (again :D).

Special thanks go to those contributors: Yves JANIN, Remi Duraffort
and Christophe GUILLON.


Release v0.6.1
==============

* Add `/tmp` to the list of mirrored paths when using -M.

* Fix the ELF interpreter extraction.

* Rewrite the build system.


Release v0.6
============

New features
------------

* Added support for "asymmetric" path mirrors.

    The command-line option for mirrors was extended to support the
    syntax "-m <p1>:<p2>" where <p1> is the location of the mirror
    within the alternate rootfs and <p2> is the path to the real
    directory/file.  For instance you can now mirror the whole host
    rootfs in the directory "/hostfs" within the alternate rootfs that
    way::

        proot -m /:/hostfs ...

* Added an option to disable ASLR (Address Space Layout
  Randomization).

    RHEL4 and Ubuntu 10.04 use an ASLR mechanism that creates
    conflicts between the layout of QEMU and the layout of the target
    program.  This new option is automatically set when QEMU is used.

* Added "/etc/resolv.conf" and $HOME to the list of mirrored paths
  when using the option -M or -Q.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed the detranslation of getcwd(2) and readlink(2).

* Improved the build compatibility on old/broken distro.

* Added support for pthread cancellation when QEMU is used.

* Set QEMU's fake argv[0] to the program actually launched, not to the
  initial script name.

* Create the path up to the mirror location to cheat "walking"
  programs.
