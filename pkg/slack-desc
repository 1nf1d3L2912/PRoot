proot: proot (chroot, mount --bind, and binfmt_misc without any privilege)
proot:
proot: PRoot is a user-space implementation of chroot, mount --bind,
proot: and binfmt_misc.  It relies on ptrace, an unprivileged
proot: system-call, available in every Linux kernel.  This means that
proot: users don't need any privilege or setup to do things like:
proot: using an arbitrary directory as the new root file-system or
proot: making files accessible somewhere else in the file-system
proot: hierarchy or executing programs built for another CPU
proot: architecture transparently through QEMU.
